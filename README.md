# Equibel

## Introduction

*Note: This project is still under construction. More documentation will be available soon.*

Equibel is a toolkit for working with equivalence-based belief change.
It can be used in two ways:

1. Programmatically, via the **equibel** Python module, or
2. Interactively, via the **equibeli** command-line interface

## Currently Supported Platforms

* OS X with Python 2.x

## Installation

It is recommended that you install Equibel into a *virtual environment*.


1. Create a project directory and a virtual environment:

        ```
        mkdir equibel_projects
        cd equibel_projects
        virtualenv venv --python=python2.7
        ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

        ```
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. Get the source code by cloning this repository:

        ```
        git clone git://github.com/asteroidhouse/equibel.git
        ```

4. Enter the equibel directory and run pip:

        ```
        cd equibel
        pip install .
        ```
